# 🍕 justeat

This is a web app built with React.js, styled-components and axios.

> :warning: Just Eat API (https://uk.api.just-eat.io/) has a CORS configuration that doesn't allow requests from localhost. So to bypass it I'm using cors-anywhere (https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) that is a proxy to add CORS headers to requests. <br><br> To run this application you'll first need to access https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://uk.api.just-eat.io and confirm the button so the requests can work normally.
